510004=... An abandoned Ruin? Looks like a good place to build our new Village!
510005=We have now established all the basic structures. It's time to train some Warriors.
510007=The Training Ground is built. Let's train some Warriors there.
510008=Chief, look what we've found! I thought it was a rock.
510009=Oh my! This must be the Dragon Egg written in the Scroll! We need to hatch this egg. A Dragon could help us fend off Brago and his men!
510010=Amazing! The baby dragon hatched! To raise it, don't forget to feed it from time to time.
510011=Before the Dragon grows up, it needs our protection. We should train more troops.
510012=There are many beasts in the Stable. We may  domesticate them and get some Riders. The more kind of troops you own, the more powerful your army will be!
510013=Oh-oh! These wolves sure have a good appetite... We need to get more Food.
510014=The Farm is built. It's time to think about where our people will live. Before that, we should get some Wood.

510018=Except for the Novice Gift, there are also other items. You should check what they do.
510019=The Mystic Library records many ancient technologies. We should do some research to build our abilities.
510020=Cheif, these technologies help us a lot. Please keep researching all the time!
510021=Chief, under your leadership we are getting stronger and stronger. In case anything happens, please bind your account as soon as possible.
510022=Chief, to save your progress, please choose a suitable way to bind your account.
510023=Chief, you just joined a Clan to fight against the pirates. Now I'll show you the Clan Interface.
510024=The Clan has elites from everywhere. United you can rule the seas!
510025=When the Building's level gets higher, the upgrading time gets longer, too. Fortunately we have some Speedups.
510026=Speedup Items vary in class and speedup time. Please choose them carefully before using.
510027=Now your building can upgrade immediately, isn't that amazing? If you don't want to wait for a long time, you should use some Speedups
510028=As we develop the town, the requirement for resources increases as well. Resources on the island aren't enough. Luckily, we can always go out and gather more.

510035=Chief! The Clan Hall is now unlocked! We should build it now!
510036=Chief! The Clan Rally Point is now unlocked! Let’s build it now!
510037=Aha, another puny Clan on the run! You won't escape my sword! 
510038=Phew! We are safe, at least for now. But a wall isn't enough for defending Brago's Elite Forces. We should train some soldiers now.
510039=Hurry! Brago is coming! This seems to be an abandoned city. Let's see if the turrets are still working.
510040=Aha, another puny Clan on the run! Go get 'em, my minions!
510041=We are so lucky! These turrets are much more powerful than we thought. Let the pirates suffer!

They are one of the specialties to look out for if you ever do find yourself in that part of the world.\nIn the early days, many Taiwanese snack markets were near the temples. In recent decades, with the development of Taiwan's economy, many large urban department stores arranged snacks on the streets in front of their buildings.\nDue to their unique food culture, Taiwanese snacks are often purchased in some rather unique night markets. At the beginning, many night markets popped up in crowded locations, so most of them are beside temples or busy road intersections. As Taiwan continued to develop, the night markets became common sight and now play an important part in Taiwanese culture.\nTaiwan’s fish balls are one of the most appreciated snacks.

It made its first appearance in 1959 and has been adapted into movies, games and even a theme park! The comics have been translated into over 110 languages and have sold over 350 million copies worldwide. \nThe story is centered around a small Gaulish village, on the coast of modern day Brittany, a province in Gaul (now France). By 50 BC, Julius Caesar has conquered all of Gaul except for this small enclave, vexing him to no end. Surrounded on all sides by the sea and 4 unlucky Roman garrisons, the villagers are able to resist repeated attempts by the Romans to invade them due to a magic potion brewed by the village druid, Getafix. Asterix, the eponymous hero, is a rather short but fearless warrior known for his cunning and down-to -earth attitude. He is often entrusted with missions on behalf of the villagers and village chief, Vitalstatistix. He goes on the quests armed with the potion that bestows superhuman strength and is almost always accompanied by his closest friend, Obelix. Obelix is a simple-minded menhir sculptor well known for being “big boned” but prefers to refer to himself as well covered or whose chest has “slipped a bit”. Obelix fell into the magic potion during his childhood so he is no longer allowed to drink it, much to his dismay. In one of the stories, the two of them adopt a small dog called Dogmatix.  This smart, nature-loving creature has a short temper and absolutely no sense of direction when it comes to sniffing out a trail. He is usually seen tagging along on the pair's adventures, adding to the mischief and helping them in some situations.\nMy Lord, help the trio collect magic potion to keep their village safe. You can collect 1 to 3 magic potions by attacking Monsters in the Kingdom map. Use the magic potions and receive rewards in exchange.

On  the eve, which is the 31st of October, besides celebrating the arrival of a new year, the Celts would also ask for blessings from their ancestors and good-hearted spirits by giving them food offerings.\nHalloween  celebrations used to be simple and were usually held in churches. As  time went on, however, the festival is now a fun-filled day in  which people scare one another and share ghost stories.

It dates back to the 5th of November 1603, when a group of men, led by Guy Fawkes, secretly buried 36 barrels of gunpowder underneath the House of Lords in an attempt to assassinate James I and his Parliament. The plot was discovered when one of his collaborators reported him. Fawkes was arrested on the spot. He and his accomplices were later sentenced to death.
