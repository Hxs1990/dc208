150199=Halloween  is approaching! This festival originates from the Celtic New Years celebration.  2000 years ago, the Celts lived in modern-day Ireland,  England and Northern France. The 1st of November was their New Year. On  the eve, which is the 31st of October, besides celebrating the arrival of a new year, the Celts would also ask for blessings from their ancestors and good-hearted spirits by giving them food offerings.\nHalloween  celebrations used to be simple and were usually held in churches. As  time went on, however, the festival is now a fun-filled day in  which people scare one another and share ghost stories. On Halloween, people dress  up in different sorts of interesting, and sometimes even bizarre, costumes,  and the children go 'trick or treating' by going from house to house knocking on doors and demanding to be treated to candy.\nMy Lord, to celebrate this exciting festival, we have prepared a special in-game Halloween Event! During the Event, terrifying Pumpkin Monsters will appear in the Kingdom Map. Kill them to obtain Evil Pumpkins. When you gather at resource points, you will obtain Candy. Feed the Evil Pumpkins with Candy to obtain Happy Pumpkins.

150182=Astérix
150185=Magic Potion
150184=<Astérix>  is a famous French comic series written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo.  It made its first appearance in 1959 and has been adapted into movies, games and even a theme park! The comics have been translated into over 110 languages and have sold over 350 million copies worldwide. \nThe story is centered around a small Gaulish village, on the coast of modern day Brittany, a province in Gaul (now France). By 50 BC, Julius Caesar has conquered all of Gaul except for this small enclave, vexing him to no end. Surrounded on all sides by the sea and 4 unlucky Roman garrisons, the villagers are able to resist repeated attempts by the Romans to invade them due to a magic potion brewed by the village druid, Getafix. Asterix, the eponymous hero, is a rather short but fearless warrior known for his cunning and down-to -earth attitude. He is often entrusted with missions on behalf of the villagers and village chief, Vitalstatistix. He goes on the quests armed with the potion that bestows superhuman strength and is almost always accompanied by his closest friend, Obelix. Obelix is a simple-minded menhir sculptor well known for being “big boned” but prefers to refer to himself as well covered or whose chest has “slipped a bit”. Obelix fell into the magic potion during his childhood so he is no longer allowed to drink it, much to his dismay. In one of the stories, the two of them adopt a small dog called Dogmatix.  This smart, nature-loving creature has a short temper and absolutely no sense of direction when it comes to sniffing out a trail. He is usually seen tagging along on the pair's adventures, adding to the mischief and helping them in some situations.\nMy Lord, help the trio collect magic potion to keep their village safe. You can collect 1 to 3 magic potions by attacking Monsters in the Kingdom map. Use the magic potions and receive rewards in exchange.

DO NOT GIVE ANY MAGIC POTION TO OBELIX!

Now that they have arrived safely in your Castle, you decide to retrieve the weapons on their behalf. It is the time to show your hospitality towards your guests!\n As the weapons are scattered all over the Kingdom, you need to look for them in resource points. You will find them by gathering there. The villagers around your Castle have also placed the weapons they have found in the resource points in your Castle. Harvest resources to recover them. These weapons will be returned to the guests once used. To thank you for your help, they will present you with even more gifts!

Sword Swipe deals 1 damage. Thunder Bolt deals 3 damage. Fire Storm deals 5 damage. When you use a critical hit, the damage will be tripled.\nThe more you connect, the more damage you will deal to the monster.\nWhen the monster is defeated, you will receive a treasure chest.

They are one of the specialties to look out for if you ever do find yourself in that part of the world.\nIn the early days, many Taiwanese snack markets were near the temples. In recent decades, with the development of Taiwan's economy, many large urban department stores arranged snacks on the streets in front of their buildings.\nDue to their unique food culture, Taiwanese snacks are often purchased in some rather unique night markets. At the beginning, many night markets popped up in crowded locations, so most of them are beside temples or busy road intersections. As Taiwan continued to develop, the night markets became common sight and now play an important part in Taiwanese culture.\nTaiwan’s fish balls are one of the most appreciated snacks. Fish balls have a long history in Taiwan. As the snacks developed over time and the selection became more diverse, the fish balls became a specialty of their own: delicious, nutritious and healthy. The small balls, white in color, taste amazing. \nDuring the event, Lords can defeat monsters to receive meat stuffing and flour, and collect resources to receive salad dressing.

In Britain, this may be regarded as one of the most beautiful nights as great bonfires will be lit and fireworks set off throughout the evening.\nBonfire Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Night, is a traditional British holiday. It dates back to the 5th of November 1603, when a group of men, led by Guy Fawkes, secretly buried 36 barrels of gunpowder underneath the House of Lords in an attempt to assassinate James I and his Parliament. The plot was discovered when one of his collaborators reported him. Fawkes was arrested on the spot. He and his accomplices were later sentenced to death. To celebrate the failed assassination attempt, it was declared that bonfires and fireworks be used to observe this day. Every year British people gather together and burn an effigy of Guy Fawkes on a big bonfire to commemorate the failure of the gunpowder plot. \nDuring the Event, Lords can gather resources in the Kingdom Map (except at gold mines) to receive Pyrotechnics.
